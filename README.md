Also, 3 other things are important about Sulfur:

1. It's 1 atomic level above [Selenium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium) in the table of Chemical Elements
2. _is VERY smelly!_
3. It sits on top of [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/)

In my daily use of the tool I have identified few "repetitive problems" that you have to solve to go from "tests
on your development environments" to "tests running as part of an automated CI".
